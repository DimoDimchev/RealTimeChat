## Installation

In order to run this project locally you need to have Node JS and MongoDB installed on your machine.

After you clone the repository run:

```bash
  npm install
  npm start
```

I have installed `concurrently` and `nodemon` as development dependancies and with only one command both the backend and frontend will run
